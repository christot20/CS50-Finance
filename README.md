nice one, you did it
talk about how you had to implement a sql database in sqllite, use flask for backend and make all functionality and use bootstrap for the looks
how it was a cs50 project and first step at full stack web dev
how u went above and beyond by adding requirements to passwords and allowing deposit/withdraw
and how u went to the trouble of putting it on heroku, fixing ur code, changing ur database and migrating to postgres, and staying up just to see it work, like with history and the formatting being off
good job :)
